# Introduction

The Mautic website serves as a hub for the Mautic community, showcasing innovative projects that align with our mission and values. The purpose of this article is to provide clarity on the criteria and process for listing projects and integrations on the Mautic website's home page.

# Criteria for Inclusion

Projects featured on the Mautic website home page are selected based on their popularity and relevance to Mautic users. The decision to list a project is primarily made by the marketing team, considering factors such as the project's impact, use cases, and overall community value.

1. Popularity:

- Projects that have gained popularity within the Mautic community are more likely to be featured on the home page.

- Popularity may be determined by factors such as community engagement, user feedback, and adoption rates.

2. Use Cases:

- Projects that demonstrate a clear alignment with Mautic's use cases and goals will be given priority.

- The marketing team will assess how well a project addresses the needs of Mautic users and enhances their experience.


3. Members:

- Projects that are members of Mautic will be given priority over those that are not.

# Maintenance Responsibilities

The maintenance of projects listed on the Mautic website home page is the responsibility of the marketing team. This ensures consistency, accuracy, and a seamless experience for visitors.

1. Content Updates:

- The marketing team will regularly review and update the information related to listed projects to reflect their current status, features, and any relevant changes.

- Project maintainers are encouraged to communicate updates to the marketing team for timely inclusion.

2. Removal of Inactive Projects:

- Inactive projects, or those no longer aligning with Mautic's goals, may be removed from the home page to maintain relevance.

- The marketing team will communicate with project maintainers before removal, providing an opportunity for clarification or updates.

# Priority for Open Source Projects

Projects with an open source nature are given priority for listing on the Mautic website home page. Open source aligns with the collaborative and community-driven spirit of Mautic. However, partner projects may also be considered based on their significance and value to the Mautic ecosystem.

1. Open Source Priority:

- Open source projects are favored for inclusion due to their accessibility, transparency, and collaborative nature.

- The marketing team encourages the community to actively contribute to open source projects.

2. Partner Projects:

- Partner projects, while not open source, may be considered if they provide substantial value to the Mautic community.

- The inclusion of partner projects will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, with a focus on mutual benefit.

# Conclusion

The Mautic website home page serves as a dynamic platform to showcase projects that enhance the Mautic experience. The marketing team, as the primary decision-maker, will ensure that the listed projects align with Mautic's mission and provide value to the community. Regular updates and clear communication between project maintainers and the marketing team will contribute to the success of this initiative.
