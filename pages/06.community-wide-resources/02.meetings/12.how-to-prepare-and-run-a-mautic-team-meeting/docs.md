## Meeting cycle; Async vs. Live meetings
The frequency of team meetings is entirely up to each team to decide; a typical cycle would be **“every 14 days”**. It should normally always be on the same day of week.

When deciding on the hour of the meeting, keep in mind that the Mautic community is spread around all time zones of the globe. The primary way we tackle this is to use **[“asynchronous” meetings][async-meetings]**, where all conversation happens in Slack threads (exactly one thread per agenda item) over a period of 24 hours.

There is of course the option to do **live meetings** as well. Some teams do this on a regular basis (e.g. every 2nd meeting), some “on demand”. We highly recommend to add an async meeting to every live meeting (by writing all highlights from the live meetings down in Slack, and continue from there) - to make sure nobody is excluded, and also to easily capture the minutes from the live part.

Now for those live meetings we obviously do need an exact hour. Even the exact start of an async meeting is not irrelevant, since most of the discussion happen within the first 60 minutes or so. And if nothing else: Someone (you) has to kick off the meeting at that hour.

So the **exact starting hour** of all scheduled meetings requires a bit of negotiation too. Best practice is:
a) Find a starting hour that is **convenient for you and most of your active team mates**.
b) **Consider alternating** between the earliest and the latest convenient hour possible, so that we have the best chances of offering a convenient slot for people in most parts of the world at least every 2nd time.

Always remember to avoid barriers for potential new volunteers (which you are probably not aware of) !

## Preparing for a meeting
### High-Level Agenda
Have a general “framework” agenda that you typically work with, e.g.
1.   Introductions - who you are, how you’re using Mautic and <whatever else you want to add>
1. Review last meeting’s (no-Trello) notes & actions 
1. Review Trello board
1. Specific upcoming events
1. Any other Business
1. Ensure that action items are all explicit (ideally: in Trello); review priorities
1. Date, time and mode of next team meeting

Feel free to have variations of the above, like
* “swap 1 and 2”
* “1 is not needed because we have it all in Trello”
* “3 doesn’t make send for us, but xyz does”
* “in 2 we only look at select items in Trello, not the entire backlog”
* …

Don’t forget: Please do experiment! Let the structure improve over time, and of course: Adopt to temporary circumstances.

### Specific Topics within the Agenda
Next, collect the existing topics for each top-level agenda item.

This is easy when it comes to “cards from Trello” or “Leftover topics from last meeting”, but do not forget to be the most forward-thinking person - come up with new areas, thoughts and ideas, and also identify challenges that the time should tackle!

Add an open topic (“other”) where appropriate.

Example agenda:
0. Introductions - who you are, how you’re using Mautic and <whatever else you want to add>

1. Review last meeting’s (no-Trello) notes & actions 
1.1 canva.com
1.2 Places of Discussion (Slack vs. Trello vs. Forum vs. Github)
1.3 Motion to remove Trello integration from t-community

2.  Review Trello board
2.1 Ensure all teams have an onboarding person/workflow
...

### Make Agenda items stick out in Slack
Instead of regular numbers (like 1.4), prefix every item with Slack emojis, e.g.
   `:one:.:four: `
which will show up as:
    
    ![Slack Emojis](slack-emoji-numbers.png)

Your agenda might  now look something like this:
:zero: Introductions - who you are, how you’re using Mautic and <whatever else you want to add>

:one: Review last meeting’s (no-Trello) notes & actions 
:one:.:one: canva.com
:one:.:two: Places of Discussion (Slack vs. Trello vs. Forum vs. Github)
:one:.:three: Motion to remove Trello integration from t-community

:two:  Review Trello board
:two:.:one: Ensure all teams have an onboarding person/workflow
...

## Post meeting invitation and Agenda in Slack
Remind people about the upcoming meeting, e.g. the day before.

Most important:
* Give exact time & date (e.g. using [everytimezone.com][everytimezone])
* Explain mode of and access to meeting
* Invite everybody, explicitly including those who have not previously been active but would like to listen in
* CC your team members (using @) to make sure they actually receive the heads-up

Should you have suitable Social Media channels, feel free to advertise there as well.

If you have your meeting Agenda ready, post it along with the invitation.

### Example:
Hey everyone, we have our #t-community team meeting tomorrow, Thursday:
  UK time: 11:00 am
  Your time: https://everytimezone.com/s/12345 
This will be an asynchronous meeting so please join the discussion whenever you are available and as often as you can, within the next 24 hours.
/cc @teammember1 @teammember2 @teammember3 ...

Or, if it's a live meeting:
Hey everyone, we have our #t-community team meeting tomorrow, Thursday:
  UK time: 11:00 am
  Your time: https://everytimezone.com/s/12345 
This will be a live meeting, everyone who can make it is very welcome to attend in person via Audio (optionally Video): https://meet.jit.si/mautic-community-team

For continuation (and also for everybody who can not make it to the live call) we will turn every meeting topic into a thread right here in Slack, so you can still join the asynchronous follow-up discussion whenever you are available and as often as you can, within the next 24 hours.
/cc @teammember1 @teammember2 @teammember3 ...


## Prepare your Meeting content
For each sub-level Agenda item,
1. prepare contextual information (like link to Trello card),
1. think hard what you want to achieve, tell or ask on this item, and put that in words,
1. even if you have nothing specific, come up with an opening statement for the item.

(Even for the first item - Introductions - it’s nice to update your words for every meeting)

As a result, your prepared notes could now look like this:

:zero: Introductions - who you are, how you’re using Mautic and <whatever else you want to add>
Hi! I’m Ekke, acting team lead, and also part of the largest Mautic agency in the universe. Currently very busy preparing our anniversary party which we’re throwing tomorrow. If you’re in the area, please come :)

## Running the async meeting
### Opening the meeting
At exactly the scheduled time, you should hit the enter button and send the opening text for the meeting. Here’s an example:
Hi everyone... Welcome to our team meeting! 

We're doing this one as asynchronously. If you haven’t done an asynchronous meeting before: It's really simple and self-explaining, all you need to remember is
---> Please respond in threads :smiley:

------
Also note you can start a reply with 
:bust_in_silhouette:
 to be anon, or 
:no_entry_sign:
 to go off the record and not be included in the notes, which will be exported and saved to Google Docs, and posted on the Community Forums.

IMPORTANT: This team meeting starts now and will be open on Slack for 24 hours, after which the notes will be exported. People may comment thereafter but these won’t be included in the notes.
----
Let’s get going! 
:arrow_down:

Or, if it's a live meeting:
Hi everyone... Welcome to our team meeting! 
We're doing this one live (https://meet.jit.si/mautic-community-team), but add threads in Slack in parallel for asynchronous attendance. If you haven’t done an asynchronous meeting before: It's really simple and self-explaining, all you need to remember is
---> Please respond in threads  :smiley:

Also note you can start a reply with 
:bust_in_silhouette:
 to be anon, or 
:no_entry_sign:
 to go off the record and not be included in the notes, which will be exported and saved to Google Docs, and posted on the Community Forums.

--
This team meeting starts with the live call on https://meet.jit.si/mautic-community-team and will be open on Slack for 24 hours, after which the notes will be exported to the Forum. People may comment thereafter but these won’t be included in the meeting notes.

Let’s get going! 
:arrow_down:

### Kicking off and discussing the agenda items
Next, post the agenda items one by one. Create a thread for each item immediately, using the prepared statements / questions. (Hint: Try hard to concentrate - it’s so easy to mix up posts and threads :)

The pace for this can vary, but better get all agenda items launched in the first 15 minutes or so.

Afterwards (or in parallel if you like) will want to join the actual discussion. Finally!

### Ending the meeting
After 24 hours (doesn’t have to be really exact, you will want to explicitly end the meeting. 
One way to do so is by responding to the “Hi everyone... Welcome to our team meeting!” post, with the “Also send to #<name of channel>” checkbox ticked, something like
Thanks everyone! This meeting is now officially over and I am moving the content to the forum.
