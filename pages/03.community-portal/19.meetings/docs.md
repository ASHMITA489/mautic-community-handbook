## About meetings

Meetings are where people come together to discuss or inform about a given topic. All the meetings have a given location (where the meeting will happen - which could be online) and start and end date and time (when the meeting will happen).

### Types of meetings

Regarding the location, depending on the configuration of the meetings component, you can have:

* **In-person meetings:** where you get together in a given physical location

* **Online meetings:** where you get together using an external service (for instance Zoom or Jitsi Meet) - the online link is shared on the event just before it starts and throughout the meeting.

* **Hybrid meetings:** where there is an online meeting which is also being streamed online

### Registration

Through registrations you can have capacity control of the attendance for a meeting. With this feature, for instance, you can limit how many people could attend to the meeting, or you can know before the start of a meeting if you need to find a bigger room to have the meeting.

Enabling this feature will add a button so that participants can express their wish to go to the meeting. Depending in how this feature is configured, then:

* it’s possible to define how many slots are available for controling the maximum capacity for this meeting

* a custom registration form for asking information to participants can be configured

* administrators can make invitations to other participants or people that isn’t registered in the platform

* it’s possible to control attendance to the meeting through registration codes

When registering to attend a meeting, users are presented with the option to show their attendance publicly, and also whether they are attending on behalf of another group.



The default should be to register attendance through the community portal but if an external ticketing system is to be used, it's possible to provide a link to the booking page.

## Creating a meeting

Check the [Decidim documentation](https://docs.decidim.org/en/develop/admin/components/meetings.html#_create_a_new_meeting) for guidance on creating a meeting and explanantions of the different form fields.

### Adding an agenda

Please ensure that an agenda is added to meetings. It helps people to better understand what is going to be discussed, and allows you to keep focused when running the meeting.
