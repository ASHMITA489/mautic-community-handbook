In this article, we're exploring Processes in the new Mautic community portal - what are they, why we would use them, how you use them, and why they're important in the Mautic community. 

If you prefer to watch this in video format, you can do so here:

So let's go ahead and click on Processes in the top main menu, and you will notice that there's some text at the top, just like there was in Assemblies, which explains to you what a participatory process is.

## What is a participatory process?

Basically, it's a sequence where you go through making a proposal, the proposals are reviewed, they're voted on or prioritized, and then we make a decision on what to do. 

Processes could be used for anything from voting on who's going to be on the Council, to deciding new features in Mautic, to figuring out what kind of swag we're going to have for the next MautiCon and having people design some proposals, and we then ask the community to vote and then decide which ones we go forward with.

So you can see there's lots of different ways that we might use a participatory process within the community. At the moment, we have two processes that are live, and I'm going to talk you through the council elections one to start with, because that's probably the easiest for people to understand.
