Groups are used in Decidim for several purposes:

* To allow you to participate on behalf of an entity (for example joining a meeting or endorsing a proposal on behalf of your team)
* To allow groups of people to automatically join an assembly by virtue of their group membership
* To allow groups of people to have conversations together

## Creating a group

Groups have to be created by individuals, and are then verified by the Community Portal Working Group.

1. Go to your public profile, via the user menu.
2. Click on 'Create group' at the bottom left of your user profile:

![create-group-button](create-group-button.png "create-group-button")

3. Use the team email address with your group as a suffix - e.g. community-team+portalwg@mautic.org - the team will confirm via email.
4. For official groups, use the Mautic logo for the avatar.
5. Click 'invite participants' to add other members:



6. Ensure that you add at least one other administrator, ideally someone from the Community Portal Working Group.

Once created, groups can be found via the Groups menu or when [searching and filtering by Groups](https://community.mautic.org/search?filter%5Bterm%5D=&filter%5Bwith_resource_type%5D=Decidim%3A%3AUserGroup&filter%5Bwith_scope%5D=).

Official groups are indicated by a blue circle with a white star inside.

## Acting on behalf of a group

When you are an administrator of a group, you have the ability to act on behalf of a group. This might include:

* Attending a meeting or event on behalf of a group
* Endorsing a proposal on behalf of a group

When eligible, you will see a check box which allows you to take action on behalf of the group:

![register-meeting](register-meeting.png "register-meeting")

By checking the box, the group name - rather than your name - will be shown in relation to the action (e.g. as an attendee of a meeting, or endorsing a proposal).
