Certain areas of the Community Portal have features restricted to members of Mautic's General Assembly - for example to interact in the General Assembly, to nominate and vote on proposals for elections, and so forth.

Membership is managed via a list which is regularly uploaded to the Community Portal, containing the currently active members.

## Uploading the list

This is currently a manual task which is carried out at least once a week, usually on a Friday.

1. Download [transactions](https://opencollective.com/mautic/transactions) from Open Collective, including the name and email address of the 'opposite account' via a custom export.
2. Paste the email addresses only (no header row) into the first sheet in this spreadsheet (request access if needed) and go to file>download to export to csv.
3. Upload the csv file under admin panel > membership list > Mautic membership list in the Community Portal.
4.
