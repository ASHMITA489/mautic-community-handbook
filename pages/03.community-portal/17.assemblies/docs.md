In this article we're going to be exploring assemblies, what they are, why they're important, why you might want to get involved with using them, and what you can do. 

## Getting started with Assemblies

Assemblies can be found via the link on the main menu. 



An assembly is a grouping of people who come together to make decisions about specific things or to run different parts of the community. 



We have different reasons for having assemblies. So some of them are relating to decision making and governance - such as the Council and the General Assembly, but there's also assemblies for teams, meetup groups and working groups as well. An assembly can also have assemblies nested within it - for example the MautiCon Working Group is nested within the Community Team because that is the team in which it belongs.

And that goes down to quite a long way. So you'll see here within the Community Team, we have two assemblies within that Community Team. So let's have a look and see what this is. So the Community Team, it tells you again, you can dismiss this box if you don't want to see this. At the top, there's always a hashtag associated throughout the whole of this platform, there'll be a hashtag. If we want to, we can hide this box. This tells you about the team, or the assembly, or the working group, or its reason for being, basically. It explains to you what the team does, what the tasks are, why it exists, really. And it tells you, how long it's going to last for, because sometimes they will exist for a finite period of time to do a particular thing, and that will be explained in the side menu here. Now something important, in this whole community portal, there's a concept of following. If you follow something, you will get updates whenever there's changes in that thing that you follow. So if we were to follow the community team, anytime there's a new meeting organized or a new blog post or anything like that, we will get pinged to let us know.

So that's good if you're interested in that particular thing. When you're in the overview of the assembly, at the top you've got a sub menu, so this is what I would call the assembly menu, and this is what I would call the main menu at the top here, assembly menu here. It tells you the assembly, this is the overview.

You can see the members of the assembly, so this would be like the people who are the lead or the assistant lead. It might be the main contributors who are actually driving this assembly forwards. It could be other people who hold other roles in that assembly team project, whatever. And that can be different components along this menu.

Components

So in the Community Team, you'll notice we've got a blog. Anything across the whole of the community portal can have a blog and they all get put out into the activity feed. So it's a great way of keeping people apprised of what your team is working on and what your project is doing. And in this case, you can see that there's an official post from the team asking for people who are interested in promoting Mautic in their local regions - to become ambassadors - to come and tell us that they're interested.

And then we've got meetings here, which I'll come back to in a minute. So on the homepage of the assembly, this will be the same for every assembly across the whole of the portal. We've got our information. If there are meetings in this assembly, we'll see them here. So you can see that there's some meetings organized here for the Community Team.

If there's more than three, then you'll be able to click here to go through to see all of them. If there are assemblies within the assembly, they'll be listed here. So you can see Mautic meetups and the MautiCon working group because the Community Team is responsible for everything that is to do with the community, and that includes organizing multi cons and it includes supporting and facilitating Mautic meetups. And as I mentioned, they can also have assemblies within them. So you see that the Mautic meetups assembly actually has five Mortek meetup groups within it. And then there's some stats at the bottom, which we're not too worried about.

Meetings

So if we go into the meeting, so we'll have a look at this one, for example, it will tell you over here about the date. I'll just cancel this just to make it easy to show. So you can see information about the meeting, like what's going to go on in the meeting. You can add comments here and I can join the meeting here to indicate that I want to attend. An important thing that we need to bear in mind is within this community platform, you can act as yourself, but you can also act on behalf of, say, a Team that you represent or a Working Group that you represent or a Tiger Team that you represent. So if I join this meeting, I can join this meeting as myself, but I could also check this box and it gives me the option of all of the teams that I'm actually a part of, which are groups, which I'll explain in a later video to say that I'm actually representing this Team, this Group, this Tiger Team, this whatever, when I attend this meeting.

And then there's a check box to say show my attendance publicly. So  if you don't want your attendance to be shown, leave that unchecked. So if I click confirm, you can see down here that it now shows that I'm attending. If I cancel that registration, and then I register and say I represent the marketing team, say I'm joining the Community Team on behalf of the Marketing Team, show my attendance publicly, then you can see that it's showing my attendance actually as the marketing team, rather than just me personally.

So you know that there's a representative of the Marketing Team who's coming to that meeting. So all of the meetings will have that option to join as you or to join  as a team or a project or whatever that you're associated with.   Also you can stop following the event if you don't want to get notifications, for example, and you can add comments as you or as a team that you represent.

So that's meetings. Meetings are the same across the whole portal, and when we go to this meetings tab, we can actually see all the meetings for this team. These are upcoming meetings, but we can also show all meetings. So it will show us past ones as well. And when a meeting closes, you can actually close and say, What was discussed, you can share a link to the minutes, you can share what proposal you discussed in that meeting and what was accepted and what companies attended and all that kind of stuff. So there's lots of things that you can do. So that's assemblies, basically. And you'll notice that some of them are slightly different. They're organized slightly differently, but you can go and have a look to your heart's content and explore what the different assemblies do.

When you look at this view, you'll always see the next upcoming meeting, so it's always easy to see the next upcoming meeting for a Team if you're interested in joining or Assembly or what have you. I think that's all we need to go through as regards to Assemblies. We'll do some different in depth videos on the Council and the General Assembly and things like that.

 If you have any questions, please drop them in the comments. That's great. Thanks very much.
