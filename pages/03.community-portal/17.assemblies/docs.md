In this article we're going to be exploring assemblies, what they are, why they're important, why you might want to get involved with using them, and what you can do. 

If you prefer to watch this in video form, you can do that here:

## Getting started with Assemblies

Assemblies can be found via the link on the main menu. When you access this page you will notice that there are some assemblies which are highlighted, followed by the full list of top level assemblies.

An assembly is a grouping of people who come together to make decisions about specific things or to run different parts of the community. 

We have different reasons for having assemblies. So some of them are relating to decision making and governance - such as the Council and the General Assembly - but there are also assemblies for Teams, Meetup Groups and Working Groups as well. 

An assembly can also have assemblies nested within it - for example the MautiCon Working Group is nested within the Community Team, because that is the team in which it belongs.   This is denoted by the card having a stacked appearance, and listing the number of assemblies within it,  as seen in the Community Team here.

## Exploring Assemblies

When you click through onto an assembly you will be presented with the overview page.

![assemblies-overview](assemblies-overview.png "assemblies-overview")

1. Where it has been set, there's a hashtag which relates to the specific assembly. 
2. The main page for an assembly will provide you with an overview which is basically the charter for that organised group -  what they do, and why they exist.
3. If this assembly has a finite time for existence -  for example if it exists to support a specific event -  this will be listed in the metadata of the page on the right hand side.
4. The follow button is common across the whole of the community portal,  allowing you to get updates from assemblies, groups, processes and so forth by clicking the button. Think of it as similar to following on social media pages
5. Each assembly will have a submenu with different components depending on the assembly's need
6. Any upcoming scheduled meetings will show in a list, and where there is an option you will be able to join the meeting by clicking through. After meetings are completed you will be able to view minutes and notes.
7. If an assembly has sub-assemblies they will be listed in this section.  Remember that assemblies **and** sub-assemblies can have assemblies within them!
8. At the very bottom of a page will be some statistics about the assembly.

### Members

An assembly has formal roles including:

* Lead
* Assistant lead
* Contributor
* Custom defined roles

When you click on the members item in the assembly menu it lists the formal members.

If you are interested in an assembly the best thing to do is to follow that assembly to get updates.  When you start practically contributing to an assembly in some way, the team will make you a contributor or whatever the formal role that's relevant for the assembly is called.

### Components

#### Blog

In the Community Team, you'll notice we've got a blog. Anything across the whole of the community portal can have a blog and they all get output into the activity feed, so it's a great way of keeping people apprised of what your team is working on and what your project is doing. 

In this case, you can see that there's an official post from the team asking for people who are interested in promoting Mautic in their local regions - to become ambassadors - to come and tell us that they're interested.

#### Meetings

Another popular component that we use in the portal is meetings.  Meetings can be online, hybrid or in person, and there is an option to filter using select boxes and a search box to show all meetings, upcoming meetings, past meetings, and also to filter by type.

There is an option to export the calendar, which is great if you want to ensure that the meetings for a particular assembly are in your personal calendar.  This creates a URL which you can subscribe to in your calendar of choice, so it is updated automatically.

Click on the meeting to learn more about what is being discussed, 

And then we've got meetings here, which I'll come back to in a minute. So on the homepage of the assembly, this will be the same for every assembly across the whole of the portal. We've got our information. If there are meetings in this assembly, we'll see them here. So you can see that there's some meetings organized here for the Community Team.

If there's more than three, then you'll be able to click here to go through to see all of them. If there are assemblies within the assembly, they'll be listed here. So you can see Mautic meetups and the MautiCon working group because the Community Team is responsible for everything that is to do with the community, and that includes organizing multi cons and it includes supporting and facilitating Mautic meetups. And as I mentioned, they can also have assemblies within them. So you see that the Mautic meetups assembly actually has five Mortek meetup groups within it. And then there's some stats at the bottom, which we're not too worried about.

Meetings

So if we go into the meeting, so we'll have a look at this one, for example, it will tell you over here about the date. I'll just cancel this just to make it easy to show. So you can see information about the meeting, like what's going to go on in the meeting. You can add comments here and I can join the meeting here to indicate that I want to attend. An important thing that we need to bear in mind is within this community platform, you can act as yourself, but you can also act on behalf of, say, a Team that you represent or a Working Group that you represent or a Tiger Team that you represent. So if I join this meeting, I can join this meeting as myself, but I could also check this box and it gives me the option of all of the teams that I'm actually a part of, which are groups, which I'll explain in a later video to say that I'm actually representing this Team, this Group, this Tiger Team, this whatever, when I attend this meeting.

And then there's a check box to say show my attendance publicly. So  if you don't want your attendance to be shown, leave that unchecked. So if I click confirm, you can see down here that it now shows that I'm attending. If I cancel that registration, and then I register and say I represent the marketing team, say I'm joining the Community Team on behalf of the Marketing Team, show my attendance publicly, then you can see that it's showing my attendance actually as the marketing team, rather than just me personally.

So you know that there's a representative of the Marketing Team who's coming to that meeting. So all of the meetings will have that option to join as you or to join  as a team or a project or whatever that you're associated with.   Also you can stop following the event if you don't want to get notifications, for example, and you can add comments as you or as a team that you represent.

So that's meetings. Meetings are the same across the whole portal, and when we go to this meetings tab, we can actually see all the meetings for this team. These are upcoming meetings, but we can also show all meetings. So it will show us past ones as well. And when a meeting closes, you can actually close and say, What was discussed, you can share a link to the minutes, you can share what proposal you discussed in that meeting and what was accepted and what companies attended and all that kind of stuff. So there's lots of things that you can do. So that's assemblies, basically. And you'll notice that some of them are slightly different. They're organized slightly differently, but you can go and have a look to your heart's content and explore what the different assemblies do.

When you look at this view, you'll always see the next upcoming meeting, so it's always easy to see the next upcoming meeting for a Team if you're interested in joining or Assembly or what have you. I think that's all we need to go through as regards to Assemblies. We'll do some different in depth videos on the Council and the General Assembly and things like that.

 If you have any questions, please drop them in the comments. That's great. Thanks very much.
