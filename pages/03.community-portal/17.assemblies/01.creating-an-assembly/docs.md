An assembly is a grouping of people who come together to make decisions about specific things or to run different parts of the community.

We have different reasons for having assemblies. So some of them are relating to decision making and governance - such as the Council and the General Assembly - but there are also assemblies for Teams, Meetup Groups and Working Groups as well.

An assembly can also have assemblies nested within it - for example the MautiCon Working Group is nested within the Community Team, because that is the team in which it belongs. 

>>> The main difference between participatory processes and assemblies is that assemblies don’t have phases, meaning that they don’t have timelines.

## How to create a new assembly

The first step before you create an assembly, is to decide which top-level assembly it should sit within, if any:

* Community Team
* Education Team
* Legal and Finance Team
* Marketing Team
* Product Team
* Council
* General Assembly

Think carefully before you create a new top-level assembly.  Remember that assemblies can be created within assemblies at any level of nesting - for example we have:

_Community Team > Mautic Meetups > Mautic Meetup cityname_

Once you have decided where the new assembly should sit, follow this process to create the assembly:

1. Log in as an administrator
2. Browse to the Assemblies section in the administrators portal
3. Find the assembly which you want as your parent assembly - note that this icon will be black if there are sub-assemblies within the assembly, clicking it will reveal the list of sub-assemblies.

4. Click on the assemblies icon (as above) of the parent assembly
5. Click on 'new assembly' - in this case I am creating a new assembly within the Mautic Meetups assembly, which is within the Community Team assembly.
