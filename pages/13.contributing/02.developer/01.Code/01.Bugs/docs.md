## Reporting a Bug
---

If you think you've found a bug, please let us know. This helps us build a better Mautic for everyone.

! If you think that you have found a security vulnerability, please email security@mautic.org with as much detail as possible. The core team will review the vulnerability and if found applicable, will create the patch in a private repository. The vulnerability will be disclosed once the patch has been included into a release.

Before submitting a bug:
- Double-check that nothing is wrong with your local installation, like permission issues, outdated cache, etc. - please read the [Troubleshooting][troubleshooting] guide!
- If you're not sure whether the issue is really a bug, please ask for help in the [Mautic Community Forums][forums]

If you're quite sure that the issue is a bug, please [report it][report-bugs] in our GitHub repository and provide us with as many details as possible (reproduction steps, Mautic/PHP versions, etc.). The more details we have, the easier it is for us to try and troubleshoot your issue.
