We are always looking for people to help us with writing content for mautic.org, our marketing and communications, and our social media campaigns.  We also have a lot of technical writing opportunities in the Mautic Community, including our Knowledgebase, developer blog and developer documentation.

As a project, we also apply to the Season of Docs each year - keep an eye on social media for future opportunities.

## Getting started

The first thing to do is to join #t-marketing on [Slack][slack] and introduce yourself!

### Writing for the blog / website

The Marketing Team maintains a [Jira board][jira-board] specifically for content and editorial work.  Our boards are publicly accessible, but you will need an account to be assigned issues or add responses. Please drop a message in the Marketing Team channel if you need an invitation to Jira.

Once you have found an article you'd like to work on, please check the writer's brief which will be attached as a Google Doc, located in our shared drive. The brief should explain what the article should include, the audience we are intending to target, and some useful resources to help you get started.

Please write the content in the Google Doc, and when you're ready to have it reviewed just drop a message in Jira and let people know in Slack.

Please note that we do check to ensure that articles are not copied from other locations without due credit, so please do not copy/paste chunks from other websites as your content will be rejected.

It helps if you can provide an image to use with the article. This must be royalty free or a license to use the image be granted to the Mautic Community. We use [Unsplash][unsplash] and [Pixabay][pixabay] to find royalty free images.

## Technical writers
If you're a technical writer, or interested in writing content for a technically-minded audience, we have lots of tasks in the [Education Team's Jira board][edu-jira]. There are opportunities to write for the [Knowledgebase][kb] - which may include tutorials, best practice and examples of how to do specific things in Mautic. 

We can also feature deep dive technical articles on the blog in the [developers section][dev-blog], including code examples and demo applications.

The [developer documentation][dev-docs] is always looking for new contributors, so if you'd like to help by adding more examples, updating and improving the content or making suggestions for improvement, please let us know!

If there are no open issues covering the area you'd like to write on, please contact the Marketing or Education Team on Slack and explain what you'd like to write.
