## Google Summer of Code Application Process
Interested in applying for Google Summer of Code with Mautic? Here is how you do that!

The following are specific guidelines for students to use to submit an application for the GSoC program through the Mautic Project. Please go through these carefully and follow them. Applications must be complete by the deadline. Late applications cannot be accepted.

## Important
* Timelines are set by Google for the entire program. Follow the timeline.
* Applications are due in Google’s system by March 31st, 2020 18:00 (UTC).
* Applications Must be filed in the Google system. No other material can be read or accepted.
* The final application is required to be submitted as a PDF.

##  Student Application Process

### Learn
Before you do anything, learn about the program and about Mautic. Our mentors do not have the time to explain to you what Mautic is, how it works or how to get set up locally - all of that is already well documented.

These links may be helpful:

* [GSoC official site][gsoc]

### Communicate
Begin communicating with the community. Our community members can help you understand the existing project proposals. If you’re going to try and propose your own project, this is a great way to understand the needs of the project and find a mentor.

* Join us on [Slack][slack] at #gsoc-discuss
* Join the Product Team chat in #t-product
* Get involved with our monthly pre-release sprints

Don’t forget to contact mentors on projects that interest you to learn more. If you’re going to propose a project you must have a mentor at the time of proposal.

### Apply

Student applications open on March 16, 2020.

The application process consists of 5 steps:

1. Create an account on the [Forums][forums] and Slack
2. Join the #gsoc-discuss and #t-product channels on Slack
3. Sign the [MCA][mca] using Docusign

Submit the application/proposal including all requirements in the next section at the Google Summer of Code Site. We **strongly** encourage you to not submit your final PDF until you get feedback about the proposal from your mentor(s).

Help is available! Share your application in progress and get feedback. The mentors can help verify your understanding of the project and provide guidance on whether your plan is good.

If you are submitting an original proposal you **must** find a mentor. Proposals without mentors will be rejected. Sharing your proposal is key to doing this. 

If you don’t want to share your proposal publicly consider using something like a Google Doc and sharing a link with the mentor/reviewers. 

### Google Summer of Code Application and Supplemental Material Requirements
In addition to the information Google requests, the Mautic Project requires you to submit the following information:

* What project are you applying to? Seriously consider choosing a project for proposal from ideas list. While it is possible to propose your own project, it is often more successful for you to select one that is already proposed by a mentor.
* Contact Information - List your Name, Email Address, Blog URL, and any additional contact information you think we need. We tend to email so be sure you’re reading your email.
* About You - Consider these questions
  * Do you have any past involvement with the Mautic Project or another Open Source project as a contributor? What kind of contributions have you made (code and non-code)? Please share any public contributions you have made (urls, etc.)
  * What are you studying? Why?
  * What motivates you to do your best? How do you stay focused? Briefly describe how you organize your work.
* Why Us? - Consider these questions
  * Why do you want to work with the Mautic Project?
  * Do you plan to continue contributing to the Mautic Project after GSoC? If yes, what project(s) are you interested with?
* Why This Project? - Consider these questions
  * Which specific project interests you? If you are proposing your own project, do it here. If you are proposing the project, explain why it benefits the community.
  * Have you contacted the mentor(s) listed for the project?
  * What relevant experience do you have for this project?
  * What do you want to gain from this project?
  * Describe this project in your own words. What does it mean to you? What do you think the final deliverable is?
* Why should we choose you over other applicants?
* Propose a rough schedule for this project. Ideally you will have regular deliverables throughout the entire period.
* What are you specific plans from May to September (eg: Exams in university, internships, vacations..etc). We need to know if there are periods of time where you are likely to be unavailable. We are better at accommodating these periods if we know of them in advance.

>>> You must submit a PDF version of all of the information you prepare with your application using the Google site. The PDF should consist of the information from the supplemental application requirements section below. It should also contain any custom project you are proposing, if any.  We are not allowed to consider students who do not submit this PDF. Students will not be judged on the visual layout of their PDF, however all information must be readable.

### Keep communicating
We cannot overstress the importance of communication. Keep talking, and listening, to the discussion group, to the sub-projects relevant to your proposal and to potential mentors. Be patient, as mentors and other contributors are often very busy people.
