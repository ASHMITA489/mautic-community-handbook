Please check out our [Trello team][trello-issues] for tasks to work on!

Cards labeled with Design are relevant to designers - you will find them in the team boards.

Many of our Community, Education and Marketing Team tasks will require designer collaboration, please join [#community][community-slack] if you'd like help finding relevant tasks to work on.

We also have a public [#design][mautic-design] channel.
