## Contributor roles

We have developed formalized processes for contributing as a designer, developer, marketer, tester, translator and writer. We're an open and evolving project, so if you don't fit into any of these roles, please let us know and we will work with you to create it!

 Please check out our Trello issues for tasks to work on! Cards labeled with Design are relevant to designers. Any future cards should also use this label too! Many of our Community and Marketing Team tasks will require designer collaboration, please use Slack for communication. We also have a public [#design](https://mautic.slack.com/archives/C02HU8FQM) channel.
