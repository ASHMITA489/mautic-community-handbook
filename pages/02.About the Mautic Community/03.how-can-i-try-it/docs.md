You can download Mautic for free at mautic.org/download. There are no limitations on what you can do with Mautic when you host it yourself.

Generally we recommend that you host it on a VPS rather than shared hosting, particularly if you intend to use it in a production setting on lower end hosting which may have limitations on resources available, thus preventing Mautic working efficiently.
