Contributing to Mautic's documentation
######################################

So you're interested in contributing to Mautic's documentation? That's fantastic. Mautic is always looking for help to improve the documentation and make it as useful as possible for the Mautic community. There are three main repositories on GitHub open to contributions. These are:

1. The :xref:`User Documentation` - :xref:`User Docs GitHub` 
2. The :xref:`Developer Docs` - :xref:`Developer Docs GitHub`
3. The :xref:`Community Handbook` - :xref:`Community Handbook GitHub`

Getting started
***************

You can work with the documentation locally, using DDEV and an editor like VSCode. This allows you to make changes and see them in real-time on a locally hosted version of the documentation. It's recommended as you can benefit from having syntax highlighting, and also generate the docs to verify the layout of your work as you go.

You can also use the web-based tool :xref:`Gitpod`, which allows you to spin up a temporary cloud-hosted instance of the documentation, make changes, and submit a pull request to have your changes merged back into the main repository. You can also test PRs with Gitpod, too.

Working locally
===============

To get started with one of the documentation repositories locally, it's advised to install:

- Git - :xref:`install Git`
- Docker Desktop - All operating systems, :xref:`install Docker Desktop` - or Colima - Mac and Linux, :xref:`install Colima`
- DDEV - :xref:`install DDEV`
- VSCode - :xref:`install VSCode`
- GitHub CLI - :xref:`install GitHub CLI`
